# Task Management System

This project is a **Task Management System** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides a simple and efficient way to manage tasks with features to create, view, update, and delete tasks.

## Features

- **Create a Task:** Add tasks with a title, description, due date, and status.
- **View All Tasks:** Display all tasks in a list format.
- **Update Task:** Edit task details or update their status (e.g., Pending, Completed).
- **Delete Task:** Remove tasks with a confirmation prompt.
- **Filter Tasks:** View tasks filtered by their status.
- **Error Handling:** Includes basic validations for empty fields and error messages.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Others:** Axios for API requests, Mongoose for database operations

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- npm or yarn

## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the database connection:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add the following:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
     PORT=5000
     ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React app will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Run the Application

1. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud-hosted MongoDB instance.
2. Start the backend server as explained above.
3. Start the frontend React app.
4. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to use the Task Management System.

## Demo

(Optional) Include screenshots or a short demo video to showcase the app's functionality.
